My grandfather, Stefano DeFina, helped to mold me into the person that I am today. When I was young, he taught me this prayer:

> Io ma curcu. Mâ€™ha durmisci. Diu lu sapi, si mi pisci

The prayer is remembered in my grandfather's native dialect of Italian. Sadly, few people speak this dialect today.

The prayer is also an example of my grandfather's pious impiety. It almost says:

> I put myself to bed. I fall asleep. God alone knows if I shall wake.

This was a well-known Italian prayer.

However, the last word of this prayer is not "wake". Look at it closely and use your imagination!
