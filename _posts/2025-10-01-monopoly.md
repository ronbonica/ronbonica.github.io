I learned to play the game of Monopoly as a child. In Monopoly, each player 
begins with a token, fifteen hundred dollars, and a fair chance.

To some extent, luck determines the outcome of the game. At the beginning of each turn, 
each player rolls a pair of dice. A few unfortunate rolls at the beginning of the game can doom
a player's prospects.

To a much greater extent, strategy determines the outcome of the game. The player who
takes every opportunity to purchase property early in the game generally wins.

It is theoretically possible for a game of Monopoly to last forever. In this case, no
player establishes a clear advantage over all of the others. So, that player and at least
one other continue to play, turn after turn, maintaining a neutral cash flow.

Personally, I have never witnessed such a game.

Generally, when one player gains even the slightest advantage over the others, that advantage
grows exponentially. Because monopoly is a zero-sum game, the other players' prospects to decay 
quickly.

When children play Monopoly, the game generally ends when the first player goes bankrupt.
Sometimes the game ends because that child loses interest and distracts the others. Sometimes 
it ends because that child throws a temper tantrum. Either way, the game is never completed.

Sometimes adults play until all players, except for the winner, have gone bankrupt. This demonstrates
the problem with the game of Monopoly and with unbridled capitalism. At the end of the game, the winner
has no one left to play with.

The winner might continue to take turns until he has drained the bank, but then what.

As is the game of monopoly, so is unbridled capitalism. When a few  people have all of the money,
to whom will they sell? From whom will they buy?
