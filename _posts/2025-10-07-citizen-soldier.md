Felix A. Bonica was born to immigrant parents in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 1943, 
he joined a militant antifascist organization. He was inducted into that organization
just after his 21st birthday.

Sometime soon after basic training, he sent this picture home to 
his beloved Florence DeFina. We know that this picture was soon after 
basic training because he isn't wearing any stripes yet.

  Because Pvt. Bonica had been a welder in civilian life, he was 
  assigned to the 123rd Armoured Anti-Aircraft Battalion and was promoted
  to the rank of Technical Sargeant. Over the next two years, he saw more combat
  than anyone his age should ever see.

  Helen of Troy may have launched 1,000 ships, but Florence DeFina sent one 
  tough paesano into the European Theater. She must have been impressed by
  Sgt. Bonica's wartime heroics, because they married in 1946.
