Felix A. Bonica was born to Stefano and Maria Bonica in 1922. In 1943, he joined a militant antifascist organization. He was inducted into that organization
just after his 21st birthday.

Sometime soon after basic training, he sent this picture home to 
his beloved Florence DeFina. We know that this picture was taken
soon after basic training because he isn't wearing any stripes yet.

  Because Pvt. Bonica was a welder in civilian life, the Army  
  assigned him to the 123rd Armored Anti-Aircraft Gun Battery. He was 
  quickly promoted to the rank of Technical Sargeant and sent to the European
  Theater.  Over the next two years, he saw more combat
  than anyone his age should ever see.

  Helen of Troy may have launched 1,000 ships, but Florence DeFina sent one 
  tough paesano into the European Theater. She must have been impressed by
  Sgt. Bonica's wartime heroics, because they married in 1946.

Somehow, Sgt. Bonica forgot to his government issued bayonet to the 
United States Army.  It came home with him to Massachusetts.

In 1947, the Bonica's has a son, named Felix after his father. In 1953, they had another son named John. In 1958, I came along.

Sometime before I was born, my father decided that it wasn't safe to have a bayonet in a house with two boys who enjoyed playing army. So, he used a vice to crimp the bayonet's metal sheath. This made it impossible to draw the bayonet.

My father passed away in 1969. In time, my brothers and I grew up and moved away. But my mother, Florence,  kept the bayonet until her death in 2001. That's when it came into my possession. By then, I had a son, named Martin, and a daughter, named Dorothy.

When my son grew to be a man, I offered the bayonet to him. I also offered to have the crimp removed, so he could draw it from its sheath. He insisted that the crimp remain. 

He realized that the crimp was a memorial to the day that my father found peace.
On that day, I realized that my son had grown wise.
